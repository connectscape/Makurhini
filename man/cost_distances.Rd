\usage{
cost_distances(
  x,
  id,
  LCD = "least-cost",
  resistance = NULL,
  CostFun = NULL,
  ngh = NULL,
  mask = NULL,
  threshold = NULL,
  geometry_out = NULL,

  ram.java = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class sf, sfc, sfg or SpatialPolygons. The shapefile must be in a projected coordinate system (number of patches > 2).}

\item{id}{character. Column name with the patches id.}

\item{LCD}{logical. If TRUE “least-cost distance” is estimated(default) else "commute-time" , analogous to the resistance distance of circuitscape, will be estimated (See, gdistance package).}

\item{resistance}{raster. Raster object with resistance values (landscape friction). Consider using a range of resistance values between 1 and 10, where 10 is the maximum resistance to movement, NA should be a complete barrier.}

\item{CostFun}{A function to compute the cost to move between cells. The default is the conductance
(isotropic cost distance):  function(x) 1/x[2].}

\item{ngh}{numeric. Neighbor graph (directions) for distance calculations: 4 (von Neu-mann neighbourhood), 8 (Moore neighbourhood) or 16 (king’s and knight’s moves). Default equal 8.}

\item{mask}{object of class sf, sfc, sfg or SpatialPolygons. For higher processing speed use this option to clip the resistance at the extent of the mask.}

\item{threshold}{numeric. Distance threshold, pairs of nodes with a distance value above this threshold will be discarded.}

\item{geometry_out}{numeric. Avoids the "Inf" error and corrects the "Inf" distance values when some spatial geometries are out
of the resistance extent. The raster NA values will be replaced by a Resistance value that must be provided by the user
using this argument, so that it is possible to calculate cost distances for all the pairs of nodes.
 If NULL, then a Euclidean distance will be calculated to find these distances.}

\item{bounding_circles}{numeric. If a value is entered, this will create bounding circles around pairs of core areas
(recommended for speed, large resistance rasters or pixel resolution < 150 m).
Buffer distances are entered in map units. Also, the function is parallelized using
 and furrr package and multiprocess plan, default = NULL.}

\item{least_cost.java}{logical. If TRUE then the programming language and computing platform 'java' will be used
to estimate the least-cost distance USING only the FORMULA: function(x) 1/mean(x). It is necessary to have java installed. This option use
the package 'graph4lg' to reduce computation times. WARNING: This function only works with
integer type resistance raster (it does not accept decimals or floating point resistance).}

\item{cores.java}{numeric. Computer cores used to run the .jar file (see, graph4lg), default = 1.}

\item{ram.java}{numeric. RAM gigabytes to run the .jar file (see, graph4lg), default = NULL.}

\item{pairwise}{logical. If TRUE a pairwise table is returned (From, To, distance) otherwise it will be a matrix.}

\item{write_table}{character. "" indicates output to the console.}
