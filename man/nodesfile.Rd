\usage{
nodesfile(
  nodes,
  id = NULL,
  attribute = NULL,
  area_unit = "m2",
  restoration = NULL,
  weighted = FALSE,
  write = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{sp, sf object, RasterLaryer or SpatRaster (terra package). It must be in a projected coordinate system.}

\item{id}{character. If nodes is a shappefile then you must specify the column name with the node ID
in the shapefile data table. If nodes is a raster layer then raster values (Integer) will be taken as "id".}

\item{attribute}{character or vector. If nodes is a shappefile then you must specify the column name
with the attribute in the data table selected for the nodes.
If nodes is a raster layer then it must be a numeric vector with the node's attribute. The length of the vector must be equal to the number of nodes.
 The numeric vector is multiplied by the area of each node to obtain a weighted habitat index.
 If NULL the \bold{node area} will be used as a node attribute, the unit area can be selected using the "area_unit" argument.}

\item{area_unit}{character. If attribute is NULL you can set an area unit, ?unit_covert
compatible unit ("m2", "Dam2, "km2", "ha", "inch2", "foot2", "yard2", "mile2"). Default equal to "m2".}

\item{restoration}{character or vector. If nodes is a shapefile then you must specify the name of the column
with restoration value. If nodes is a raster layer then must be a numeric vector with restoration values
to each node in the raster. Binary values (0,1), where 1 = existing nodes in the landscape, and 0 = a new node
 to add to the initial landscape (restored).}

\item{weighted}{logical. If the nodes are of raster type, you can weight the estimated area of each node by the attribute. When using this parameter the attribute, which must be a vector of length equal to the number of nodes, usually has values between 0 and 1.}

\item{write}{character. Output folder path if you use the name option, otherwise, place the output path, with the name and extension ".txt"}
}
\value{
nodo file in .txt format
}
\description{
Generates a table with the Core ID and the their attribute value (e.g. area in kmÂ²), using a shapefile with these values.
